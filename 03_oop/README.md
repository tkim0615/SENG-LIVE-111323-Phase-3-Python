### Define Object Oriented Programming
- programming that's oriented around data rather than function. 
- Based on the concept of object containing data (attributes, properties) and procedure(function and method)

### Explain the benefits of Object Oriented Programming
- Modularity - easy to debug 
- Inheritance - reusability of code 
- scalability - Easy to build out 


### Explain the principles of Object-Oriented Design
- single responsibility 
- separation of concern 
- abstraction / DRY
