    # Python environment set up

# ðŸš¨ To enable ipdb debugging, first import "ipdb"
# import ipdb

# 1. âœ… Create a condition to check a pet's mood
    # If "pet_mood" is "Hungry!", "Rose needs to be fed."
    # If "pet_mood" is "Rowdy!", "Rose needs a walk."
    # In all other cases, "Rose is all good."

    # Note => Feel free to set your own values for "pet_mood" to view various outputs.

# pet_mood = "Hungry!"
# pet_name = "Rose"
#1. solution
# if pet_mood == "Hungry!":
#     print(f'{pet_name} needs to be fed.')
# elif pet_mood == 'Rowdy!':
#     print(f'{pet_name} needs a walk.')
# else:
#     print(f"{pet_name} is all good.")

# time = 'dinner'
# if time == 'morning':
#     print('eat breakfast')
# elif time == 'afternoon':
#     print('eat lunch')
# elif time == 'dinner':
#     print('eat dinner')
# else:
#     print('go to sleep')

# 2. âœ… Create a ternary operator using "pet_mood" as a condition:
    # If pet_food is "Hungry!" => "Rose needs to be fed."
    # In all other cases => "Rose is all good."
# pet_mood = "Hungry!"
# pet_name = "Rose"
# #2. solution
# print(f"{pet_name} needs to be fed") if pet_mood == 'Hungry!' else print(f"{pet_name} is all good.")
# time = 'dinner'
# print('eat breakfast') if time == 'morning' else print('study python')


# 3. âœ… Create a function (say_hello) that returns the string "Hello, world!"
    # Test invocation of "say_hello" in ipdb using "say_hello()"
    # say_hello() => "Hello, world!"

#3. solution
# def say_hello():
#     print('hello world')
# say_hello()


# 4. âœ… Create a function (pet_greeting) that will return a string with interpolated pet's name
    # Test invocation of "pet_greeting" in ipdb using "pet_greeting()"
    # pet_greeting("Rose") => "Rose says hello!"
    # pet_greeting("Spot") => "Spot says hello!"

#4. solution
# def pet_greeting(name):
#     print(f"{name} says hello!")
# pet_greeting('Rose')

# # can do math operation inside f 
# print(f'{2*3}')

# def schedule(time):
#     print(f"It's {time}, let's eat breakfast.")
# schedule('morning')




# 5. âœ… Move conditional logic from Deliverable 1 into a function (pet_status) so that we may use it with different pets / moods
    # Test invocation of "pet_status" in ipdb using "pet_status(pet_name, pet_mood)"
    # pet_status("Rose", "Hungry!") => "Rose needs to be fed."
    # pet_greeting("Spot", "Rowdy!") => "Spot needs a walk."
    # pet_greeting("Bud", "Relaxed") => "Bud is all good."
    

    # Take a moment to note that "pet_name" and "pet_mood" parameters are within Local Scope and take priority over "pet_name" and "pet_mood"
    # in Global Scope.
#5 solution
def pet_status(pet_name, pet_mood):
    if pet_mood == "Hungry!":
        print(f'{pet_name} needs to be fed.')
    elif pet_mood == 'Rowdy!':
        print(f'{pet_name} needs a walk.')
    else:
        print(f"{pet_name} is all good.")
pet_status("Tyler", 'Rowdy!')


# 6. âœ… Create a function (pet_birthday) that will increment a pet's age up by 1. Use try / except to handle errors. 
    # If our function is given an incorrect datatype, it should handle the TypeError exception and alert the user
    # pet_birthday(10) => "Happy Birthday! Your pet is now 11."
    # pet_birthday("oops") => "Type Error Occurred"

    # Note => To view more common Python exceptions, visit https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html


#6 solution
def pet_birthday(age):
    try:
        print(f"Happy Birthday! Your pet is now {age + 1}.")
    except TypeError:
        print("Type Error Occured")
pet_birthday('oops')

# ipdb.set_trace()
